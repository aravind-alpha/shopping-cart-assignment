[Atomic Design Pattern](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) developed by Brad Frost and Dave Olsen, is a methodology for crafting design systems with five fundamental building blocks, which, when combined, promote consistency, modularity, and scalability. It maps well with React's Component based architecture.

![Atomic Design Pattern](/static/images/Atomic%20Design%20Pattern.jpeg)

- **Atoms:** Basic building blocks of matter, such as a button, input or a form label. They‚Äôre not useful on their own.

- **Molecules:** Grouping atoms together, such as combining a button, input and form label to build functionality.

- **Organisms:** Combining molecules together to form organisms that make up a distinct section of an interface (i.e. navigation bar)

- **Templates:** Consisting mostly of groups of organisms to form a page ‚Äî where clients can see a final design in place.

- **Pages:** An ecosystem that views different template renders. We can create multiple ecosystems into a single environment.
